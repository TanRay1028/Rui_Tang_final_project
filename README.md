### Please install the pygame module by running: pip install -U pygame==2.6.0 
There is an anime character I like named Doro.
She is a cute pink-haired girl who loves eating oranges!
So I create the small game about her adventure of chasing oranges using the Pygame module. Hope you enjoy it!

Run main.py to start Doro Adventure  
How to play:  
1. Control Doro using the arrow keys to collect as many oranges as possible.  
2. Avoid the cat chasing you; if it catches you, it will take all your oranges!
